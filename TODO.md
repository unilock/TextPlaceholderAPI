# TODO

- Figure out how to use / replace `StringReader` (from Brigadier)
- Implement `TextColor.fromRbg()` somehow (just use the closest RGB value in `GeneralUtils.COLOR_CODES`?)
- Give the code a once-over and make sure this is pretty much adhered to:
  - `Text` = `ITextComponent` (itf)
  - `MutableText` = `TextComponentBase` (impl)
- Make sure everything works!!
- Document list of differences from upstream
